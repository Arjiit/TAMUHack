The project aims to let the cameras in the street to detect trash in images. We used ExpressJS, HTML and CSS to design the User interface. In the user interface, users can upload the images by clicking uploading file button. Users can choose to upload photos of kinds of trash and these photos will be stored in the database. All the photos in database is used by cameras to detect similar trash in the street. And we access the Google map api. The original place in the google map is College Station. Google map API is used to pilot the location of each photo
